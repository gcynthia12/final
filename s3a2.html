The availability of this “public facing” data allows developers to build connected/supplementary platforms that may ease or augment a user’s experience. In teams of two, students will work together to create and execute an interactive design tool that employs API linking with IFTTT (If This Then That). Teams must also design and develop a website that serves to promote this tool and document its real-life application and usage.</p>
