            <h3>Ulises Carrión - Selections from Second Thoughts</h3>
            <p>Overall, <i>Selections from Second Thoughts</i> provides a lot of interesting perspectives on how books are not just containers of text, which I had honestly not given a lot of thought to before and broadened my perspective. For example, the section "Poetry and Prose" illustrates the idea that the making of books is an art form and it can be a much more exciting and creative process than simply writing texts. Linguistics is one of my majors, so I particularly enjoyed the section "The Language" as well—it was very interesting to read about what language is from an artist's (rather than a linguist's) perspective. I really liked the point about how language has to be abstract and words cease being what they actually refer to and become elements of structures. I also thought the comparison made between pre-Cubist/Cubist paintings and book pages/newspaper pages and how they provide one vs. multiple points of view was interesting. </p>

            <h3>Laurel Schwulst & Édouard U - Selections from Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully</h3>
            <p>I found the first essay by Schwulst incredibly thought-provoking: in our daily lives, we are used to seeing websites created primarily to display information, and it is easy to forget that clarity is only "one of many possible intentions for a website". In particular, the section "What can a website be" was very metaphorical for the most part, but really expanded my perspective on the things one could possibly do with a website. Also, Schwulst did not think "cloud" was the best way to describe the internet—however, I think if we take the perspective that a cloud is a collection of a massive number of tiny water droplets aggregated together, and that there are many, many clouds in the sky, it is not a bad metaphor. The second essay by Édouard U. discussed exploring and building networks of knowledge rather than being led along linearly, which was also very interesting. I also liked the metaphor of the mind as a garden, and "artificial learning" as gardening techniques. </p>

            <h3>Alessandro Ludovico & Florian Cramer - Selections from Publishing from Post-Digital-Print</h3>
            <p><i>Post-Digital Print</i> discusses what the increase in digital vs. print content means for publications and provides some interesting food for thought on hybrid forms between print materials. I particularly liked the idea of creatively incorporating QR codes into books or magazines that could provide new updates which could then be printed, and would thus allow the reader to interact in both physical and digital ways. I thought the big chart highlighting parallels between print and digital content was very interesting as well—all the way from dots vs. pixels to flipping through vs. clicking. I also would have never thought of zines and artists' books as a way of using print as a form of social media, and as something comparable to internet communities. The fact that this book itself was published and distributed in a hybrid way is a nice touch!</p>

            <h3>Ben Duvall - Selections from New Modernism(s)</h3>
            <p><i>New Modernism(s)</i> begins by discussing how a work of graphic design is made up of a surface and signs, with signs being typography or images or any unit of meaning, and how relationships between the signifier and the signified have changed from modernism to postmodernism and to what Duvall terms hypermodernism. I especially liked the comparison Duvall made about how "the sign becomes a hyperlink and a work of design a hypertext" (11). The following chapter, "The Hyperlinked Sign", discusses the iconography of Disney, in particular under the lens of postmodernism, how it appears frequently in the work of those who have rejected traditional institutions, and how it has been used in critical design by groups such as Grapus and Metahaven. Duvall also writes that the hypermodern Disney appears to be more straightforward, the same subversiveness is at work (40). Overall, despite having done a lot of graphic design in the past, I knew very little about these historical developments and found this reading quite interesting.</p>

            <h3>David Reinfurt - Selections from A *New* Program for Graphic Design</h3>
            <p>In these selections from <i>A *New* Program for Graphic Design</i>, Reinfurt begins with an explanation of gestalt principles (the ways in which distinct elements produce coherent groups) and discusses the work of Wertheimer, who performed experiments that explored these ideas and along with his colleagues, showed that apparent movement is indistinguishable from real movement. Reinfurt then discusses the idea of the whole being more than the sum of its parts, and how gestalt would suppose that we perceive the world first as wholes, giving the examples of optical illusions, as well as the application of gestalt to works in graphic design: for example, the textbook <i>A Primer of Visual Literacy</i> (written by Donis A. Dondis and designed by Muriel Cooper), various projects involving watch faces, and the logos designed by Paul Rand. Despite having some graphic design experience and having heard of gestalt principles in the context of psychology before, I had never given much thought to the connections between them, so I found this very interesting. Reinfurt also discusses the work of Stewart Brand, such as the Whole Earth Catalog, as well as Muriel Cooper's work at MIT considering how books might be moved to a screen, and Susan Kare's work designing a GUI, icons, and typefaces for the first Apple Macintosh. I enjoyed learning about a bit of the history of interface design and where some of the interface elements we are familiar with today come from. </p>

            <h3>Bojana Coklyat & Shannon Finnegan - Selections from Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook</h3>
            <p><i>Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook</i> begins with an introduction to what alt-text is, how to include alt-text and basic guidelines on how to write it. It then discusses alt-text in the context of other types of description, and how it is relevant for art and artists. The authors then discuss several ideas coming from the fields of poetry and translation that would be good to consider while writing alt-text and provide examples. I had always thought of alt-text as solely an accessibility practice before, so it was interesting to consider the perspective that while it should be rooted in that, it has a lot of expressive potential as well and can be thought of as a form of poetry. I also appreciated the discussion in the writing exercise about how objectivity should not be the central goal of description and the problems with approaching alt-text in that way—before reading this, I would have also assumed that an objective approach would be best. </p>

            <h3>Metahaven - White Night Before A Manifesto</h3>
            <p>Metahaven's <i>White Night Before A Manifesto</i> contains three sections, discussing ideas relevant to designers and what they mean from a political/socioeconomic point of view. The first section discusses the broad idea of surfaces and how designers work with them, what surfaces are, types of surfaces and so on. The following section discusses value, and ideas such as exchange vs. use value and how function and value or form and content were separate. The final section is on manifestos, what they are and what it means to write one, and also provides examples of some manifestos written by designers. Overall, I found the ideas in this reading to be a bit abstract and challenging to understand at times, but I thought some of the ideas it presented were interesting to consider—such as the idea of the screen as a communicative/active surface, or what happens to something like a manifesto in the age of the internet. </p>

            <h3>Ramsey Nasser - Selections from Decolonising the Digital</h3>
            <p>This reading examines the linguistic bias and subsequent inequality inherent in computer science and the challenges that arise with finding a way to bridge the gap. Nasser explains that programming languages themselves, names of libraries, terminals, text editors, and so on are by default in English and designed for the Latin alphabet, and thus favor native speakers of English. He discusses the problems that arose during his own effort to create an Arabic programming language, and how creating a programming language that truly does not depend on English is ultimately impossible because of widely used libraries and protocols that utilize English naming and are not feasible to change—I had always wondered why there weren't really programming languages in other languages, and now I understand why. He also brought up how even Unicode represents Latin characters first with smaller numbers so they use less memory, and how characters common in East Asian languages are shared despite the fact that there are variants, which I had honestly never realized. He ends with an exploration of several possible solutions, why they would not work, and whether a programming "lingua franca" might. </p>

            <h3>Paul Soulellis - Performing the Feed</h3>
            <p>In <i>Performing the Feed</i>, Paul Soulellis discusses different kinds of publishing and what it means to publish or to make something public. He begins by discussing what a post is and what he calls the old publishing paradigm, which is characterized by a visible substrate in a container fixed in time and space, where authors are known and traceable, among other features. He moves on to examine the new publishing paradigm, which instead is characterized by an unclear or invisible substrate in a fluid or even nonexistent container, where authorship is no longer fixed—discussing ideas like live streaming, feeds and their endless nature, bots, leaks, etc. He also discusses archiving as an act of using the old publishing to interrupt the new, and how going forward, we would be negotiating multiple modalities and modulating between the fixed and the flowing. and where that terminology comes from, which I had never thought about prior to reading this. Overall, I think it provided an interesting perspective on publishing that I would not have thought of myself. </p>

            <h3>Neta Bomani & Sabii Borno - Beyond Dark Matter from Logic Issue 15 Beacons</h3>
            <p><i>Beyond Dark Matter</i> is an illustrated story of Gem, a student, who is focused on working on a project when she is transported into the world inside her computer. She is greeted by "The Way", which claims to be a program that can build a complete profile of her personal history—and then shows her an overwhelming stream of historical events related to the development of the computer, the Civil Rights Movement, the Community Renewal Program etc., and how technology had been used for harm. Gem is then transported to "The Beyond", a space of community and possibility, where she learns about software as a form of control, and how many concepts in the history of computers have been based on the history of the master/slave relationship. She learns that computers can also be used for social change, and when she goes back to the real world, decides to be more involved in her community and in connecting with others. Overall, I thought that this story format was an interesting way of encouraging readers to think critically about the status quo in technology, the history behind all of it, and the terminology that they use. </p>

            <h3>Wendy Hui Kyong Chun - On Software or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge</h3>
            <p><i>On Software, or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge</i> by Wendy Hui Kyong Chun encourages readers to consider what software actually is as a concept and what the act of programming actually means. Chun discusses this through the lens of the history of programming and computation, beginning with how programming started as something numerical with the ENIAC, and then became something more problem-oriented with automatic programming (programming as we know it today). She also discusses the clerical underpinnings of programming, and how contributions made by women have been buried in the history of programming. I also found the point about how programmers themselves are now users and the line between them has become more and more blurred pretty interesting. </p>
